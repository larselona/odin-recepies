I will use this readme to write a summary of the knowledge aquired going through this module.

Another, completely unrelated, reflection - this should probably go into Notion - is that the scripts for the yoga 300h course can go into a repository in github. But that may well be overkill. Just typing them in Notion should suffice. Then I can use the video planning tool to create fhe finished script and storybook.
